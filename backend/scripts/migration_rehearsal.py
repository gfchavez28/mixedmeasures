"""Upgrade gate: run a release's migrations against an ENCRYPTED, populated DB.

Build a database at the PREVIOUS release's Alembic revision, fill it with the
rows this release's migrations put at risk, encrypt it with SQLCipher, run
`alembic upgrade head`, and assert that every row and every parent link survived.

Why it exists (the gap it closes, found at the v1.3.0 cut, 2026-08-02):

  * `dev.db` and the whole test suite run **plaintext SQLite**. The packaged
    desktop app runs **SQLCipher**. So the combination "these migrations, on an
    encrypted file, with data in it" is exercised by *nothing* — not the suite,
    not `schema_diff_harness.py` (which compares structure on fresh DBs), not CI.
  * The dangerous migrations are the ones SQLite implements as a **table
    rebuild** (`batch_alter_table(recreate='always')` = DROP + RENAME). v1.3.0
    rebuilt `segments` (every coded unit) and `excerpt` (every quote). If
    `PRAGMA foreign_keys` were ever left ON during that, SQLite's implicit
    DELETE would CASCADE into `code_applications` and `notes` and the coding
    would vanish — silently, with the app still opening fine afterwards.
  * Row COUNTS cannot see the other failure mode: a rebuild that preserves every
    row while scrambling which child points at which parent. Every assertion
    below is therefore on **identity** (id -> parent id), not volume.

This is a RELEASE-TIME gate, not a CI test: the "from" revision moves every
release, and a realistic corpus is the point. Run it whenever a release carries
migrations (RELEASING §4c).

Usage (from backend/, venv active, sqlcipher3 installed):

    python scripts/migration_rehearsal.py --from-revision b8e4c2a70d19   # v1.4.0

`--from-revision` is the Alembic head of the PREVIOUS release. Find it with:

    git show <previous-release-tag>:backend/alembic/versions/ ...   # or
    alembic history            # and take the last revision before this cut

Exits 0 on success, 1 on any failure. Writes only to a temp dir; never touches
`dev.db`, the real backup dir, or the developer's data.

# ── What THIS release's migration must do ────────────────────────────────────
#
# ⚠️ **Review this block at every cut, exactly like `--from-revision`.** It is the
# half the script was missing at v1.3.1: v1.3.0 carried only STRUCTURAL migrations
# (table rebuilds), where "every row and every link is unchanged" is the whole of
# correctness. A DATA-REPAIR migration inverts that — the rows it is supposed to
# rewrite MUST move, and a corpus on which it no-ops proves nothing while exiting 0.
#
# ── v1.4.0 (2026-08-27) — STRUCTURAL, and the two v1.3.1 fixtures CHANGE SIDES ──
#
# This cut carries exactly one migration, `d7f3a91c8b24` (Decision B provenance),
# and it is a rebuild: `batch_alter_table('dataset_columns', recreate='always')`
# to add `derived_from_column_id` + `derived_via`. So invariance IS correctness
# here, and the interesting table is `dataset_columns` — whose children
# (`dataset_values`, `recode_definitions`) are the cascade canaries, because
# SQLite's DROP+RENAME would take them with it if `PRAGMA foreign_keys` were ever
# left ON.
#
# 🔴 The v1.3.1 repairs (`a1b2c3d4e5f7` astral offsets, `b8e4c2a70d19` note
# numbering) now sit AT OR BELOW `--from-revision`, so they DO NOT RUN in this
# rehearsal. Their fixtures are kept, but seeded at their POST-repair values — the
# state a real v1.3.2 database is already in — and asserted as rows this release
# must NOT touch. Deleting them would throw away coverage of the shapes a rebuild
# damages; leaving them on the "must change" side would fail for the wrong reason,
# which is what this script did as written.
#
# What v1.4.0 must CHANGE is the schema, so the "must change" assertions below are
# structural — plus one BEHAVIOURAL check. Reflecting the FK back only re-reads
# what the migration wrote; deleting a source column and watching the dependent
# go NULL is the assertion that the declared `ON DELETE SET NULL` is real.

# The v1.3.1 fixtures, now seeded post-repair and asserted INVARIANT.
